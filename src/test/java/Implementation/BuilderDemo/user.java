public class User

    private String surname;
    private int age;
    private String emailAddress;
}

    //Then you could do the following
    public void setFirstName(String firstName)
    {
        firstName = firstName;
    }
//Repeating for all the properties.
//Most IDEs will auto generate this for you now adays

    //Or if you are using Java, you could take advantage of lombok, https://github.com/rzwitserloot/lombok
//Would look something like this
   // @Getter @Setter
   // private String firstName
//lombok would then create the getters and setters for you.
